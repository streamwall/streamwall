[data]
# By default, we use the woke.net streams data source.
# You can add other URLs to fetch here:
json-url = ["https://woke.net/api/streams.json"]

# You can also specify .toml files on disk. Streamwall will reload the data whenever the file changes.
# See example.streams.toml for a sample.

[cert]
# SSL certificates (optional)
# If you specify an https:// URL for the "webserver" option, a certificate will be automatically generated and signed by Let's Encrypt.
# For this to work, Streamwall must be accessible from both ports 80 and 443.

# Uncomment to obtain a real certificate (otherwise a testing cert will be generated)
#production = true

# Email address to use when registering SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt
#email = "hi@streamwall.io"

# Directory to store certificate
